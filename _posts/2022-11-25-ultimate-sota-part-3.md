After a few more summits, I've decided my SOTA getup needs serious work. The amateur radio community largely acts on instinct and legend, so I'd figure I actually do the math in creating an ultimate SOTA antenna.

Part 3 will cover anything and everything towards the wire antenna elements. Weight tradeoffs, guy lines, lengths, impedances, and more.

# Introduction (from previous)

This introduction is visibile on my [previous posts](https://www.n2wu.com/2022-11-13-ultimate-sota-part-1/). Essentially, antennas perform best wtih current at the physically highest radiating portion. Thus a dipole or inverted vee would be the best choice for a lightweight, ultra-efficient SOTA antenna.

So, without further ado, everything you've wanted to learn about wire.
