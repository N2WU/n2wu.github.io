After a few more summits, I've decided my SOTA getup needs serious work. The amateur radio community largely acts on instinct and legend, so I'd figure I actually do the math in creating an ultimate SOTA antenna.

Part 2 will cover one of the most unknown components of amateur radio - the balun. I'll review its purpose, use, and feasibility in this SOTA setup.

# Introduction (from previous)

I want you to close your eyes. Peek a little at a time to read if you have to or have someone read this part aloud.
Eyes closed? Ok.
Picture what comes to mind when I say "Ultimate SOTA Antenna." What shape is it? Frequency? Transmit power? Really focus on the little things and especially what makes it better than your current QRP setup.

Open your eyes. Let's compare the big picture:

## Requirements for "The Ultimate SOTA Antenna"

### Construction 

* Lightweight without complicated guy lines or solid tubes (save a fiberglass mast)
* Sets up quickly and stays up - no fuss
* No snagging on trees or getting stuck between rocks

### Performance

* Has ideal SWR without a tuner
* Continuous DX the moment it's online
* Maximum radiation efficiency - current concentrated at the highest point

In all, you want a **simple** antenna that does its **limited job very well**.
What does this antenna actually look like? I'm going to say a **single-band, half-wavelength dipole**.

Actually, I've decided to make it a dual-band design. More to follow later...

For more background to my approach, visit the [first post in the series](https://www.n2wu.com/2022-11-13-ultimate-sota-part-1/).

So, without further ado, the humble and mysterious balun.
