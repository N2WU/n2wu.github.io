To get in on the last of the winter hiking, I went on a dual activation of Black Dome and Blackhead mountains.

# The Summits: Black Dome and Blackhead

[Black Dome](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/GC-003) is a 10-point summit in the Catskills, close to [Hunter Mountain]() and [Katterskill HP](). Black Dome offers a 6-mile trail near Wyndham, Ny.

[Blackhead](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/GC-056) is another 10-point mountain less than a mile away from Black Dome and only 12m shorter. It seems less popular than Black Dome but with a name like blackhead...

From here on, to conserve expensive letters I will refer to the two as "Dome" and "Head". I realize this may still be confusing. Remember the "head" is below the "dome," if that makes sense.

[This website](http://catskillmountaineer.com/WB-bkmtnrange.html) always has great options for hikes. In all reality, I used [Caltopo](https://caltopo.com/m/1QD15) to find trails and get an elevation profile - more on that below.

NOTE: These summits have good views _close_ to the top, but the summits are rather disappointing. You can see "Head" from "Dome" too:

# Equipment

I tested out my new end-fed at the top, and had great success. I chucked it as far as it could possibly go and still needed some more length. I'm wondering if a SOTA slingshot would be helpful in the future.

Total weight - 10-15 lbs. I was pretty warm, considering it was 20-30 degrees warmer than I'm used to (0 degrees -> 22 degrees).

# Excursion

![Trail](/assets/img/sota_15/hiking.JPEG)
_Start of hiking_

The hike, like I said before, was pretty self-explanatory and thankfully safe. I recommend the microspikes, snowshoes, or anything to help with the uphill 8% grade. You get sweeping views the Northern Catskills area at the top:

The actual trail can be shown here:

And its elevation:

The backside of the mountain is surprisingly steep and clear enough for some body glissading. Once again, a feature film from N2WU youtube:

# Contacts

I put an early [SOTA Alert](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/) for about 1hr 30 mins up. I was actually only about **10 minutes late** to the contact.

I don't know if it was the new EFHW antenna, but I had a great time operating. I only spent maybe 15 minutes total operating after a combined 5 minutes of setup and teardown.

Whenever anyone asks what SOTA is like, I will always direct them to the video below. It's such a peaceful, serene, beautiful environment. And then you can hear CW oscillating nonstop.

## Contact List - Head

Oddly enough, I got my 4 contacts and the band went completely dead. I wasn't sure what it was, but I got a S2S and two activations so I packed up without complaint.

| Callsign     | Band     | Time | Location |

| KT5X | 2OM CW | 1541 | Arizona |

Here's the Google Earth (missing France). North Carolina loved me!

# Conclusion

The Catskills is one of the best places to hike period. In the winter, you have build-in slides to use at the cost of a harder trudge uphill. The serenity granted by the mountains makes it a great dual-point activation with a winter bonus.
