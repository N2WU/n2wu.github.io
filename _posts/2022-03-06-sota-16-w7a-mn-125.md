I got a quick activation of W7A-MN-125 Union Hill as my fifth activation zone. It was also my first trail-run activation, and my first 40m activation.

# The Summit: Union Hill
[Union Hill](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W7A/MN-125) is a 2-point summit in the Sonoran Desert, close to [Dixie Benchmark](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W7A/MN-125). Union hill is reachable via many trails, but we used the Cactus Wren Loop.

Honestly, as long as you can see the summit, you won't have a problem finding a trail or navigating to the top.

# Equipment

This activation was the first time I actually ran up to the summit. I have to pack my bag a little better to minimize shifting mid-flight but it makes for a quick activation!

Total weight - 4 lbs. Instead of a rock cairn to hold my antenna, I just had a friend hold it. I gave him a warning about RF exposure and he seemed fine with it.

I put an early [SOTA Alert](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/) for about 20 mins up and was pretty close - we ran 8.30 min/mile to the top.

I originally put the alert for 20m as I'm used to activating near 1300 UTC, but with the 2300 UTC activation I had to switch to 40m. Thankfully the EFHW traps worked and I switch bands without tuning!

Here's the Google Earth. Lots of chasers in the area - either ground wave or a well-placed NVIS shot.
