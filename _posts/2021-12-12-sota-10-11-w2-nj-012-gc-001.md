Short weekend activation of a "high point" in New Jersey and the highest point in the Catskill Range. I'll go over the NJ activation briefly and go into detail on the Slide mountain activation.

# The Summit, part 1: Stonetown HP

[Stonetown HP](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/NJ-012) is a 1-point, simple activation right off an intersection near Ringwood, NJ in the neighborhood of Stonetown. It is clearly visible from the surrounding area and only a quick hike up. There is a loop available about 1 mile up to get to the top safely. It's also known as "Windbeam Mountain" and gives okay-ish views of the surrounding area.

To get there, just follow the [blue trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-jersey/windbeam-mountain-overlook-trail).

# The Summit, part 2: Slide Mountain

[Slide Mountain](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/GC-001) is the tallest mountain in the Catskill Range. It towers at 4,180ft above the surrounding slide mountain wilderness area. When we went, there were several inches of ice making a bowling alley of the trail as it breaks above the treeline. Fair game in a winter activation, right?

The summit quite literally towers over the rest of the mountains, but offers the best views right before the peak:

# Equipment

Again with the new standard SOTA kit:

1. The [N2WU Case-X2](https://www.n2wu.com/2021-11-25-n2wu-case-x2/)
5. The [K6ARK](https://www.youtube.com/c/K6ARKPortableRadio) [Random Wire](https://youtu.be/kSQzUETRMlk)
4. 25ft of climbing rope with a belay carabiner
5. Hard-shell Jacket, thick shell gloves, winter beanie, and extra sweatshirt
5. CW Notebook and pen
5. A military surplus-issued J37 Straight Key. It works with the beefiest of gloves and most frozen hands.
5. 1L water
6. APRS-Enabled TM-D72A
7. Kahtoola [Microspikes](https://kahtoola.com/product/microspikes/) for winter activations
10. 1 8oz. [Fishing lure](https://www.amazon.com/FREGITO-Raindrop-Sinkers-Fishing-Weights/dp/B097R4X8PJ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=lead+fishing+weights&qid=1633300434&sr=8-9)
11. A GPS Watch with the Slide Mountain course loaded

Total weight - 10-15 lbs. I brought everything I would possibly need up there and was _still_ a little cold.

# Excursion

## NJ Activation

This summit was a joint activation with Orrin KD2WXP. We started at about 1630 (twilight for NY/NJ) and got up at 1505. I had a spot report for 1510 so I got set up quickly and made my four. We bushwacked the way up (not recommended - almost a 4 level scramble) but took the **blue** marked trail on the way down in the dark. It is a nice, gentle hike that will get you up in a breeze.

## Slide Activation

[The Slide trail](http://catskillmountaineer.com/SMW-slide.html) totaled about 5.4 miles and was a light scramble. I would be very easy except for the two or so deep streams we had to cross, and the layers of ice at the top of the mountain. I loaded a GPS file on my watch and had a topographic map handy, but the yellow and red foot trails were very easy to follow.

Like I said, the ice made a bowling alley of myself and Cavan K0SAX:

What's slightly off-putting is the lack of views at the top. You are greeted by a concrete slab:

# Contacts

I operated APRS as N2WU-9. It only registered somewhat near the summit. I couldn't get cell service anywhere at the top:

 ![APRS](/assets/img/sota_11/aprs.PNG)

I put an early [SOTA Alert](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/) for about 3hrs from our drive. We were nearly an hour early, so I sent an APRS SOTA spot and got on the map pretty quickly:

I operated CW 10W. Here's my contact list and a KML generated with advice by Steve K2GOG using the [ADIF-KML program](https://levinecentral.com/adif2map/).

## Contact List

## New Jersey

I think I managed some grey-line propagation to these stations:

## Slide Mountain

On the top of slide, my hands got cold quick. I decided to test out the straight key since my hand was frozen roughly into a fist shape:

Contacts were less-than-great, but I'll take what I can get.

# Conclusion
SOTA is better with friends. I was glad to share this 14-point weekend with other hams!
