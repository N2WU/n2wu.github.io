Intro and announcement towards subscription system.

Hi everyone, just a quick announcement. You can now subscribe to the N2WU blog via the ["subscribe tab"](https://www.n2wu.com/subscribe) at the top of the page.

To do this, I used some sources from this website: [1](https://qfimg.github.io/jekyll-subscribe-form/) [2](https://qfimg.github.io/free-domain-email-zoho/) [3](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-subscribe-form/).

I used a service called [zohomail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) to create the fancy new email address [webmaster@n2wu.com](mailto:webmaster@n2wu.com). Some may call me... a master of my domain. The steps are pretty easy to follow for verification.

Your subscription adds you to a [mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) contact list, to which I manually send an email after every new post. If anyone has any information on how to automate this, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Anyway, thanks for reading.
