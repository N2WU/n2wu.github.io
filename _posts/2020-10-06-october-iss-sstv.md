# October ISS SSTV
The International Space Station had some great passes from 04-08 October. On 05 October I was ale to go up and receive one. In this post I will just give a short recap and post my picture.

## Background

The International Space station flies at about 400km overhead with a speed of 7.660km/s blazing across the sky. Since the 1990s, amateur radio has had a prominent place onboard. The ISS has a period of about 1.5 hours - every time it makes a complete rotation around the earth. Its path is sinusoidal and non sun-synchronous however; so often its ground track changes on earth.

You can receive the signals day or night and from any angle above about 12 degrees. We use [heavens above](https://www.heavens-above.com/PassSummary.aspx?satid=25544&lat=41.3887&lng=-73.9481&loc=Unnamed&alt=0&tz=EST) to find passes.

The ISS transmits _Slow-Scan Television_, an almost fax-machine sort of radio modulation. Series of tones correspond to colors, and decoders can take this audio and convert it to images. The full image takes about 1 minute.

## Method

We saw upcoming passes on the heaven's above link (above). I picked a nighttime pass that had a high angle (72 degrees max elevation) for the best possible transmission. I received the signal with a directional **Arrow** antenna and a handheld **Kenwood-THD72A.** We have a fully functional satellite rig, but it is personally a lot more fun to catch the signal with your arm.

I got to a spot with high elevation, had my radio on standard squelch, and opened the **Robot36** app on my phone. This app (free) decodes SSTV and is super useful in these situations. I found the start azimuth (SSE), pointed my antenna, and waited.

We initially saw the ISS zip by and assumed we weren't on the right frequency. But about 3 seconds later, it came in full blast! I enjoyed "leading" the satellite with my antenna to receive the signal and got a pretty good reception out of it.

_My SSTV Capture_

SSTV is a great way to get someone into the hobby. It doesn't require a license, shows off the space station, and gives a small taste of what amateur radio is like, all within 15 minutes. It requires minimal equipment and gives a glimpse into satellite telemetry; a great stepping stone for budding technicians.
