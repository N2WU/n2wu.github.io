# Introduction

I am glad to report my **second** successful SOTA activation of South Boulder Peak W0C/FR-075. In this post I will detail my summit up, my activation, and future plans. Lace up and continue reading!

# The Summit: South Boulder Peak

[South Boulder Peak](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W0C/FR-075) is a beautiful summit to the south of Boulder. It offers more natural views than Green Mountain! I took the **Shadow Canyon trail** from [this post.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/south-boulder-peak-trail),


# Equipment

I brought my usual SOTA equipment:

1. An Elecraft KX2 with standard CW paddle
2. A [5.2 Ah lithium-ion battery](https://power.tenergy.com/at-tenergy-li-ion-18650-11-1v-5200mah-rechargeable-battery-pack-w-pcb-3s2p-57-72wh-9a-rate/)
3. An APRS-enabled TH-D72a
3. My favorite [antenna tuner](https://steadynet.com/emtech/zm2-kit-bnc-connectors)
4. A [19-foot mast](https://tmastco.com/main/page_products_telescopic_poles.html)
5. A [linked end-fed](https://qrpguys.com/qrpguys-end-fed-wire-antenna)
6. A linked dipole for 10m,20m,40m
7. 1L water, warm clothes, and gloves
8. A notebook/pen for CW
9. Several (40) feet of paracord in different lengths

Total weight - about 12lbs.

# Excursion

This was a tough route. The Homestead Trail was easily walkable, but the shadow canyon trail really gave me a run for my money. Thankfully, I rarely bumped into rocks/trees with the antenna mast poking from my backpack.

It allowed for some great views!

I even had some curious visitors when I was up there:

# Contacts

There were only some jagged rocks and bare trees at the top - I felt if I put up the antenna mast, I wouldn't have a great strategy for securing it. However, the 30-ft trees were perfect for a **lazy dipole** with the end-fed. I tied one end to paracord and tossed it as high as I could, then strung it across the entire summit face to a tie-down point at eye level.

I actually got pretty good propagation reports to 6- and 7- land. I made 3 FM simplex contacts and 3 CW contacts. It was pretty cold up at the summit, so I called SK after I got enough contacts to log it.

As I was up there, the weather started drastically improving. Blue skies on the way down!


# Conclusion

The descent was slippery, but now I could actually see the trail. On the way up, I saw the forest for the dirt.

Overall this was a great activation and I hope to do many more!
