# Digital Logic CW Beacon

Hello again, now on the new website! As a parting gift for some friends, I made an overly complicated CW beacon capable of reading morse code bits and flashing out through an LED. I will show the logic process, the schematic, and the PCB design.

Of course, this whole thing can be accomplished through a single Arduino. But this is _way_ more fun.
