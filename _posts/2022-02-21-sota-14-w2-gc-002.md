In celebration of Winter Field Day, Stephen KJ5HY and I took a hike up to the second-highest mountain in the Catskills. I'll share the beta and some promotions down below.

# The Summit: Hunter Mountain

[Hunter Mountain](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/GC-002) is an 10-point summit in the Catskills Park, close to [Kaaterskill HP](https://summits.sota.org.uk/summit/W2/GC-008), of which [I'm very fond](https://www.n2wu.com/2021-12-05-sota-9-w2-gc-008/), and right above the [Hunter Mountain Ski Area](https://www.huntermtn.com/). While we did see a lot of backcountry skiiers, we decided just to spike-hike it. Probably because we didn't have backcountry skiis either.

[Here's](http://catskillmountaineer.com/HWK-hunterBH.html) a good travel guide. We chose the harder of the two routes and paid for it sorely. I would recommend crampons or ice axes or snowshoes but it's a slog either way - there was snow up to our waist.

# Contacts

I put an early [SOTA Alert](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/) for about 2hr 30 mins up. We were **incredibly** late due to the waist-high snow.

We got plenty of contacts thanks to winter field day. Worldwide!

# Conclusion

Winter Field day was a cold and rough outing. After a rendezvous at nearby Mama's Boy Burgers, we quickly recovered for the rest of the day.
