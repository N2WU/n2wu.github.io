This illustrates modeling of a coaxial cable by using a combination of a transmission line model (for the inside of the coax) and a wire (for the outside). This is described in the manual; see "Coaxial cable" in the index. The transmission line is about 1/2 physical wavelength long. After you run the program, open the View Antenna display and use the scroll bar to magnify the current. (Turn on the Control Box via the View menu if necessary.) Note the current on the feedline. If you go to the Control Center Options menu and enter a power level, then click the Currents action button, you can see how large the current is for a given power input. At 100 watts, the current is greater than 100 mA at the center of the feedline. This may or may not cause trouble with RFI if the feedline is close to a TV transmission line, phone line, etc. Note that the coax is fully symmetrical with respect to the antenna. For an explanation of what causes the current, see "Some Aspects of the Balun Problem", by Walter Maxwell, W2DU, QST, March 1983, or "Baluns: What They Do and How They Do It" in the ARRL Antenna Compendium, Vol. 1.
